Tron
====

A C implementation of the infamous Tron game.

###Features
1. An implementation of the Minimax Algorithm - optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
2. An intelligent heuristic - a few funtions applied onto the game's Voronoi Diagram.
3. A fast implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for square grids.
4. Highly responsive & accurate input - done by creating internal command buffers.
5. Pthreads implemented - bot created in a separate thread & given limited time, just like the human player.
6. A mechanism to dynamically adjust the Minimax depth to fit into the time window of the bot.
7. A two player game mode.
8. Terminal based colored UI using Curses.


###Dependencies
1. Pthreads
2. Ncurses
